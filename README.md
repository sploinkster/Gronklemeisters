### SETUP GUIDE

- YOU WILL FIRST NEED TO LOGIN AS ROOT WITH "su"

- YOU WILL THEN NEED TO DO "sudo apt install git" 

- AND THEN "git clone [https://github.com/sploinkster/Gronklemeisters/new/main](https://github.com/sploinkster/Gronklemeisters.git)"

$~$

### WHAT IT DOES SO FAR:

- prints a silly message

$~$

### NOTES:

- make gronklemesiter delete itself afterwards (leave no trace)

- continual password changer in crontab (remember passwords on our own)

- check history using crontab for each user and kill processes that arent from our own ip
